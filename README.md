# AgriQ  

## 📌 Overview  
![Overview](https://github.com/harih-AI/AgriQ/blob/daac0cb5ec6271ec7834f9c563327fd8163a3562/New%20folder/WhatsApp%20Image%202025-03-29%20at%2007.11.58_6f4e19e1.jpg)  
AgriQ is a Tamil voice-call-based AI assistant that leverages Tamil Large Language Models powered assistant(LLMs) and Quantum Computing embeddings to provide real-time agricultural support to farmers. Designed to overcome language barriers and improve accessibility, AgriQ delivers accurate crop insights via voice calls without requiring smartphones or internet access.  

## 🚀 Problem Statement  
![Problem Statement](https://github.com/harih-AI/AgriQ/blob/c53cfcc5787ec0bd9dbe8e2d17740c786a6924a2/New%20folder/WhatsApp%20Image%202025-03-29%20at%2007.12.15_bab7f140.jpg)  
Agriculture is the backbone of many economies, yet farmers, especially in rural areas, struggle with:  
- Lack of real-time, accurate agricultural guidance.  
- Language barriers limiting access to AI-based solutions.  
- Limited internet access making app-based solutions ineffective.  
- Inefficiencies in crop planning, disease detection, and market price forecasting.

### 🌾 Example: Traditional vs. Quantum Embedding in Agriculture  
#### Tamil Word: **"மண்" (Maṇ - Soil)**  

🔹 **Traditional Embedding**:  
- Learns that **"மண்"** is related to **"நிலம்"** (Land) and **"சேறு"** (Mud) from training data.  
- Struggles to differentiate between **"மண் வளம்" (Soil Fertility)** vs. **"மண் ஈரப்பதம்" (Soil Moisture)**.  

🔹 **Quantum Embedding**:  
- **Superposition**: Keeps both meanings (fertility & moisture) active **until the context is clear**.  
- **Entanglement**: Links related terms:  
  - "உரம்" (Fertilizer) → **Fertility**  
  - "பாசனம்" (Irrigation) → **Moisture**
